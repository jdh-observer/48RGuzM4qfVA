1. A forthcoming article by Rodríguez Gómez and Urueña presents a method for exploring visual collections using interactive panels, inspired by Warburg’s Mnemosyne Atlas, to analyze the 19th‐century Carguero case.

2. The study repurposes Aventura.js—a bilingual, open‐source tool—to build digital atlases that trace symbolic connections in historical images, exemplified by Colombia’s Carguero.

3. By merging digital techniques with human interpretation, the article demonstrates how interactive panels and data visualizations offer fresh insights into visual archives via the Carguero case.

4. Inspired by Warburg’s principles, the article transforms static images into interlinked, interactive panels. Its case study of the 19th‐century Carguero deepens our understanding of visual symbolism.

5. The research shows how digital tools like Aventura.js can mediate archival inquiry. Through an interactive atlas and the Carguero case study, it offers a new approach to reading visual history.
