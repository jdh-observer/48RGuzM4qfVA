In this article we propose a methodology and a tool for exploring visual collections, based on the interrelations of historical and iconographic connections, through the use of interactive storytelling. Such methodology is strongly inspired by the work of the art historian Aby Warburg and, most especifically, by his Atlas Mnemosyne project; in this line, we propose a way of using an open source, bilingual, JavaScript library called Aventura.js to create interactive iconographic panels connected by hypertextual connections and interpretations.
Following the structure of the Journal, the article is organized in three complementary layers: the narrative layer of the article presents the context and the epistemological principles originally proposed by Warburg on his Atlas Mnemosyne project at the beginning of the XX century, and also reflects on how to expand Warburg's strategies on new ways by using digital tools. We discuss the need to develop specific tools to visualize qualitative data in image corpuses in humanities and social sciences. The hermeneutic layer of the article presents the development of Aventura.js as an electronic literature library, and its repurposing as a tool for visual digital scholarship. Subsequently we propose how this programming library can be used to create interactive exploratory panels that follow the spirit and extend the meaning possibilities of the Atlas Mnemosyne strategy. Concretely, panels organized in a 2D feature space according to categories related to the persistence, or survival, of iconographic motifs in collective memory, but, additionally, organized in a hipertextual, narrative z-dimension. As a case study that uses our methodology and tool, we provide an example dataset consisting in a collection of images that are iconographically related to the figure of the “Carguero” (Man carrier), a typical character of the 19th century Colombian visual culture. We will show how focusing attention on figures, characters or iconographic details (instead of authors, works or genres) by means of data filtering, visualization, and narrativization, allows a better understanding of the images' trajectories through different visual regimes, geographical spaces and historical periods. With this dataset, we develop all the steps involved in the design of an Atlas containing multiple interactive panels: the creation of a collection, the annotation of the images, the automation of montage and interacivity, the construction of a narrative space through the use of hypertextextual paths, and the final design decisions. Additionally we critically discuss the reach and limitations of this methodology and tool and possible further developments.

## Introduction


This article has two purposes: on the one hand, to describe a method for digital scholarship of visual sources, and, on the other, to develop an applied example based on a collection of images:


First, we propose a method and a tool to create interactive iconographic panels inspired by the strategies employed by the art historian Aby Warburg in his Atlas Mnemosyne project. We assert that interactive panels can be used as narrative means to collect, explore, and display iconographic interpretations of historical visual sources, that is, networks of iconic and symbolic associations between images. We furthermore show how the JavaScript library Aventura.js, originally intended for the creation of electronic literature, can be a helpful repurposed tool to structure and render such interactive panels, in conjunction with additional data processing and visualization procedures. Additionally, along our proposal of this method, we reflect on different problems related to the creation of tools for studying visuality in the context of digital scholarship in the humanities: specifically, the relationship between computationally and manually extracted data, linguistic barriers in software development and use, the introduction of human subjectivity into the creation and presentation of historical collections, and the design of interfaces for the elaboration of historical arguments.


Second, we offer a particular case study and demonstration built with Aventura.js that uses our proposed method: an iconographic interactive atlas of the image of the Carguero (roughly translated as “Man carrier”). Namely, the representation of subalternized people that were used as means of transport in the harsh geographical accidents of nineteenth-century Colombia, and other places in South America, and their multiple reappropriations, remixes, recompositions, and recontextualizations. With this iconographic panel, we want to present a novel interpretation on the topic and show how the reading of a collection of visual sources can be enriched in complex ways by means of computational data structures, data visualization, and non-linear storytelling.


This article is the result of an interdisciplinary collaboration, built upon different expertises —cultural history, visual studies, semiotics, and data visualization—, but also on common interests —studying visual sources with the help of computational tools. The main theoretical common ground that serves as a foundation for our proposal is the set of epistemological principles of Aby Warburg's Atlas Mnemosyne <cite data-cite="7299034/5SBJCW9X">(2012)</cite>. Warburg’s insights, we want to show, have important potential for the creation of digital tools to interpret visual sources, and offer strategies that address the limitations of conventional publication formats in academia <cite data-cite="7299034/7IRYBDQE">(Urueña Calderón, 2017)</cite> and the orthodox, iconic methods for data visualization, usually insufficient to represent the categorical data that is commonly derived from the sources used in the humanities <cite data-cite="7299034/779MQTKK">(Rodríguez Gómez, 2021)</cite>.


## Atlas Mnemosyne after digital humanities


The Atlas Mnemosyne is the unfinished project Aby Warburg worked on in the last years of his life <cite data-cite="7299034/5SBJCW9X">(Warburg, 2012)</cite>. It was a device that visually stored and displayed central aspects of Western visual memory. In Warburg's words, the Atlas was an instrument of "orientation" which, by exhibiting "iconic materials" and their visual relationships, allowed to "illustrate" the "process" of how the values of expression of "life in motion" coined in Antiquity were incorporated in the Renaissance <cite data-cite="7299034/5SBJCW9X">(Warburg, 2012, p. 35)</cite>. Although generally associated with a collection of maps, as Antón-Barco argues, "atlases are a visual form of knowledge consisting on an encyclopedic collection of related objects or entities. Its mission is to offer a multitude of elements brought together by elective affinities so that its reader can understand the world that he or she lives in.” <cite data-cite="7299034/JS2I4PY3">(2014:46)</cite>. In a sense, like the mythological referent from which it is named after, the Atlas is designed to "carry the world on its back" <cite data-cite="7299034/4TDN96K2">(Didi-Huberman, 2010)</cite>. In its final form, the Atlas Mnemosyne consisted of a set of large black fabric screens attached to frames measuring 1.50 m x 2 m, on which different photographs were grouped by attaching them with small, easily manipulated clamps <cite data-cite="7299034/HY9N8YHZ">(Didi-Huberman, 2009, p. 412)</cite>. The panels that make up the Atlas consist of sets of images organized by visual relationships, defined by certain recurring motifs of themes, gestures, and bodily dispositions found in a heterogeneity of sources not all of them considered, at the time, by art historians: from images extracted from art history books to advertisement pieces cut out from magazines. All this material was organized in groups and series, according to the links suggested by different visual, historical, and geographical resemblances. In general terms, this procedure could be described as a montage, in analogy to what Sergey Eisenstein or Dziga Vertov were developing at the time in the field of cinema, that is, as a form of disposition in space and time in which the union of parts conforms a holistic meaning (<cite data-cite="7299034/HY9N8YHZ">Didi-Huberman, 2009</cite>;<cite data-cite="7299034/UBQT2LZL">Michaud, 2004</cite>;<cite data-cite="7299034/7IRYBDQE">Urueña Calderón, 2017</cite>).

```

The procedure to organize and manipulate the elements of the collection that integrate the Atlas is related to the epistemological principle of the "good neighbor", which entails that it is possible to creatively explore archives and libraries by finding surprising relationships derived from the significant neighborliness of elements that are next to those we are looking for. The principle of good neighborliness was exercised by Warburg with help from the special spatial arrangement of his grand library <cite data-cite="7299034/9YEQKZLN">(Settis et al., 2010)</cite>, a home and research place that comprised a massive and increasing collection of books and photographs, meticulously arranged and further rearranged. Unlike most libraries, the books were not organized by subject matter, alphabetical or numerical order, but by four categories: Image, Word, Orientation, and Action, each one arranged over four floors. In this way, the Library's system leads visitors from visual image to language, then to religion, science, and philosophy, and finally to the subject matter of history, patterns of behavior, and actions. This system can be browsed in a linear way but can also be used transversally, allowing for creative exploration and surprising relationships between elements in the collection.


Good neighborliness is not based on chance but on a special consideration of the relationships between the particular and the general. Among the elements of a collection, relationships are not established by induction or deduction, that is, by absolute or statistical rules, but by an exemplary or paradigmatic logic, in which each element fosters each other according to the meaningful neighborliness between singular manifestations of the same theme or iconographic detail. In other words, it is based on the logical principle of abduction: the creative reasoning that occurs by trying to find patterns with hypothetical, provisional associations <cite data-cite="7299034/KC6UKUR5">(Peirce 1931)</cite>. The units of meaning of the collection are called *Pathosformel*, or expressive formulas. This concept appears for the first time explicitly formulated in the essay on Durero and Italian Antiquity, written in 1905 <cite data-cite="7299034/9QWY62IZ">(Warburg, 2005, p, 401-408)</cite>. Pathosformel refers to the expression by visual means of intense emotions, or *Pathos*, which are manifested in gestures or bodily dispositions. These motifs become formulas that, when copied and used as models, are resignified and adapted to new historical and geographical contexts. In addition to being essential to providing a fresh reading on the relationships of the first Renaissance with classical Antiquity, the Pathosformel can be characterized as an analysis category able to trace historical relationships between images by establishing visual correspondences. The circulation of these visual materials in time and space operates in a way that Warburg calls survival (*Nachleben*), namely, a state of latency in which the motifs represented in the images, or Pathosfomel, are maintained as they move between periods, epistemic domains, contexts of signification, media, techniques, and places. For Warburg, survival operates through copying procedures that result in dramatic inversions of meaning —in the sense of classical drama: a change in fortune. Each time these motifs come into contact with an artist, a spectator, or a scholar they are "recharged with life" <cite data-cite="7299034/X8HNX9QH">(Agamben, 2010, p. 37)</cite> and put to work in new contexts. This contact is characterized by Warburg as a “disturbing experience” <cite data-cite="7299034/5SBJCW9X">(Warburg, 2012, p. 33)</cite>, in which artists, spectators and scholars struggle between surrendering thoughtlessly to the power of the image, or, on the contrary, establishing a reflexive distance (*Denkraum*), and to make comparisons between materials in a working "space" in which different meaningful juxtapositions can be tried out. This formulation implies a conception that emphasizes the image as a presence and not as a representation. In this way, Aby Warburg is seen as a precursor of the visual studies perspective that Moxey has characterized as "ontological", that is, the one that emphasizes presence, distinctive structural characteristics, and performative effects <cite data-cite="7299034/EAJWY34J">(Moxley , 2008)</cite>.


Within the frame of reflexive distance, the interval (*Zwichenraum*) is one of the central concepts of the Atlas <cite data-cite="7299034/5SBJCW9X">(Warburg, 2012, p. 29)</cite>. That is, the symbolic meaning created not by the qualities of one single image but by its relation to others, a space in-between (<cite data-cite="7299034/4RVPEU3G">Baert 2018</cite>; <cite data-cite="7299034/HY9N8YHZ">Didi-Huberman, 2009</cite>). Such interval was graphically achieved in the original panels by the black background fabric used to establish a space between different frames. In a context in which the use of photographs and film projectors for teaching and disseminating art history research had not yet become popular, Warburg formed a large collection of photographs of the different materials he was interested in exploring (Mazzucco, 2012, 2013). These were organized in series and were positioned on the same epistemological level, that is, as having the same interpretative value or importance, by being placed on the black fabric panels <cite data-cite="7299034/UBQT2LZL">(Michaud, 2004, p. 278)</cite>. The panels were then re-photographed in order to create a single, homogenized image, which was then inserted into a series that was intended to take the form of a book that was left unfinished.


Currently, Warburg’s Atlas has served as an inspiration for imagining modes of organization and arrangement of, and relationships between, digital resources of online catalogs and databases of museums, archives, libraries, and other heritage organizations (<cite data-cite="7299034/RVS8WMLC">Brandhorst, 2013</cite>;<cite data-cite="7299034/PQPY36FK">Patti & Quiviger, 2014</cite>;<cite data-cite="7299034/2YRPMV94">Warnke & Dieckmann, 2016</cite>), and his strategy has elicited reflection about the ways of collecting, safeguarding, interpreting, arranging, and exhibiting visual materials in the digital world<cite data-cite="7299034/LDB7UQ48">(Preez, 2020)</cite>; in computational analysis, the repetitive nature of the Pathosformel has oriented the construction of algorithms that recognize certain poses or gestures <cite data-cite="7299034/LZCATTRL">(Impett, 2020)</cite>; and the particular disposition of the panels has been compared to the electronic screen of different current digital devices <cite data-cite="7299034/LDB7UQ48">(Preez, 2020)</cite>. Both the digital screen and the fabric panel frame a selection of images and enable the comparative consideration of the chosen images in proximity. Under this light, the screen makes possible a digital interval, in which the potential originally expressed in Warburg's project of, say, navigating between hyperlinks, is realized <cite data-cite="7299034/MMKZJFIN">(Doulkaridou, 2015)</cite>.


Adding to these novel readings of the Atlas in the digital world, here we intend to repurpose the Cartesian space of the digital canvas, the pixel array used as a foundation in design software and visual display on internet browsers, as an interactive panel. The copy-pasting affordance of pixel information allows putting images together for comparing their visual iconic qualities and finding symbolic relationships. The arrangement of pixels, shapes, and images according to "x" and "y" coordinates allows the construction of a feature space (<cite data-cite="7299034/DLYHLH3V">Manovich, 2015</cite>,<cite data-cite="7299034/FARLPENA">Hristova 2016</cite>) in which the metadata and extracted features of data points can be organized according to numeric values or compared based on defined categories. And the conventions of data visualization allow to structure hierarchical relationships between different categories. Additionally, the different layouts, or panels, can be organized as scenes that are navigated along a z-dimension of meaning depth that constructs an hypertextual narrative <cite data-cite="7299034/XSTGEJL7">(Landow, 2009)</cite>.


After a technical description of the tools used for our proposal, developed in the hermeneutic layer of the article, we will provide a case study example consisting of a collection of images that are iconographically related to the figure of the *Carguero* (Man carrier), the depiction of a person carrying another one, by piggy-back or using backpack chairs or other special accessories, working as a mean of transportation in difficult geographic paths; a typical character of the 19th century Colombian visual culture. This figure could be interpreted as a concrete and localized manifestation of the Pathosformel of carrying something or someone. However, it would be more accurate to say that it is an iconographic theme, which takes the form of the representation of a character or "social type,” whose variations are structured by various details, some of which can be considered Pathosformeln (gestures and bodily dispositions). The images of this character use previous models, which, through repetition, have become representational formulas that express and provoke intense emotions that, sometimes, express moral judgments to different audiences about the use of men for practices that are usually carried out by pack animals. The emotions, evaluations, experiences, and expectations that condense these representations, which can be traced to different associated textual sources, are specific historical manifestations. They account for a series of transformations related to the emergence of the modern world, such as the circumstances in which the industrial revolution, scientific revolutions, and political revolutions of the Atlantic world manifested themselves in the Latin American region. The ways in which these images are interpreted vary according to how they are situated in specific historical and geographical contexts, as well as in communities of interpretation related to travel literature, costume books, geographical relations, the literature of customs, the local press, and the international illustrated press.


The collection of images used in our case study was gathered through a search in a heterogeneity of physical and digital repositories and archives, based on Warburg's principle of good neighborliness. In this sense, it confronted disciplinary barriers that separate the images from the texts to which they are related and distribute them in different collections guarded, annotated, and cataloged by professionals from different disciplines. For example, in the Museo Nacional de Colombia (National Museum of Colombia), watercolors and loose plates can be found in the art collection, while engravings included in travel books are in custody of the history collection. This is a problem that repeats in most of the repositories visited; different visual materials receive different treatments: when they are in books, the images are ignored, and when the images are exhibited, the books, newspapers, and magazines they come from are ignored. This creates a series of problems in dealing with search strategies through queries and keywords, which adds up to the problem of the heterogeneity of classification systems and language use when searching through archives in, say, France, the United States, England, or Germany. In addition, in the collection we also included a number of popular reappropriations of the Carguero trope that are not held in repositories; we added photographs directly to the collection. The use of sources from digital and physical archives along with fortuitous findings, we intend to show, develops the potential of the inquiry possibilities derived by the good neighbor principle (<cite data-cite="7299034/RVS8WMLC">Brandhorst, 2013</cite>;<cite data-cite="7299034/PQPY36FK">Patti & Quiviger, 2014</cite>;<cite data-cite="7299034/LDB7UQ48">Preez, 2020</cite>), for this reason, we call our set of images a subjective collection, explicitly stating that the process of collection is developed by subjects, and, as such, is inherently interpretative.


For this project, it is also necessary to consider the use of digital image formats as homogenizers of the materials included in the collection. Just as Warburg used photographs to epistemologically equalize images of different formats and techniques <cite data-cite="7299034/UBQT2LZL">(Michaud, 2004, p. 278)</cite>, researchers working with digital images keep images in digital formats, such as PNG and JPG, in their folders, organized in different categories. These digital formats are used to homogenize a collection of elements coming from heterogeneous sources in order to stabilize them and put them in levels of similarity that allow comparisons, juxtapositions, and contrasts. However, this homogenization, also makes evident striking differences between archival practices: image quality, color correction, white balance, cropping, etc. As Johanna Drucker has pointed out, these operations involve unavoidable mediations between visual sources and their digital equivalents, which take place even in the cases of natively digital sources, since, between copies, compressions, and format changes, there are always transformations that “embody interpretation” and can affect computational analyses <cite data-cite="7299034/NZIIPQX3">(Drucker, 2013, p. 8)</cite>. The Carguero image collection is composed of photographed or scanned images from physical works such as bookplates, paintings, murals, sculptures, graffiti, stickers, as well as books, magazines, newspapers, loose sheets, paintings, engravings, etc. hosted in different digital repositories in various file formats (JPG, PNG, PDF, etc.). In our project, this myriad of sources is converted to a unifying format to form the collection: JPG images, and proportionally resized to fit the constrains of our interface.


In the first stages of research in preparation for this paper, the images from the Carguero collection were put in relation to each other in intuitive ways, by following procedures that tried to emulate Warburg’s compositions. One of the first solutions we attempted to adapt Warburg's panels to digital environments was to create panels with black-fabric-like backgrounds in the image processing software Photoshop, over which the images were arranged according to the spatial relationships suggested by the categories of analysis. In a second attempt, the Aventura.js library made it possible to adapt the panels made in Photoshop by defining clickable "areas" on the images, which allowed to navigate through scenes that developed iconological narratives. The new version presented here is an attempt to streamline the process of creating panels with Aventura.js by using a dataset containing a list of categorical metadata about each image, and some predefined data visualization conventions and helper functions that standardize the ways of organizing and presenting the collection. As we will show, we created a method to partially automate the creation of panels and narrative paths.


In summary, in this project, Warburg's montage was adapted to the space of the digital screen. More specifically, to HTML Canvas Elements created inside web browsers. The canvas is organized according to the "x" and "y" Cartesian coordinate system, and the images are spatially distributed according to the relationships of the categories previously defined in the dataset. These arrangements form a feature space <cite data-cite="7299034/DLYHLH3V">(Manovich, 2015)</cite>, or an interval (Zwichenraum) <cite data-cite="7299034/5SBJCW9X">(Warburg, 2012)</cite>, that makes it possible to establish a space for reflection (Denkraum) and to find similarities and differences through comparison. These charts, which we will explore in more detail below, are exported to Aventura.js and organized into scenes and areas that allow the construction of interactive hypertextual narratives. Such heuristic tool has made it possible to indicate routes of analysis, add nuances, reaffirm indications, reformulate hypotheses, and ultimately refine and visualize the categorical apparatus that organized the material and guided the development of the historical narrative.

### Steps, tools and methods
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region tags=["hermeneutics"] -->
The method we used for constructing our interactive panels can be summarized in the following steps and associated tools:
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region tags=["hermeneutics"] -->
1. Preparing the subjective collection dataset by hosting images online and defining conventional table-based metadata (CSV format).
2. Creating data subsets by filtering the main dataset with off the shelf functions in JavaScript.
3. Displaying subsets in adequate graphic representations, using vanilla JavaScript functions for manipulating the HTML Canvas Element in the Observable, notebook-based coding platform.
4. Adding a narrative z-dimension that connects all the graphic representations, that is, the panels, using the Aventura.js software for creating interactive stories.

<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region tags=["hermeneutics"] -->
Most of the tools used in this project are rather conventional and well-known: tables formatted as comma separated values, vanilla JavaScript functions for filtering and creating graphics in the browser. However, the main innovation in our project in terms of tools is the use of the Aventura.js software for generative and interactive storytelling. Aventura is a JavaScript library, intended for the creation of electronic literature and generative art. In other words, works that use computation to help the production of visual and textual elements or to structure the navigation of a narration. Aventura.js provides a set of functions with which it is possible to create generative texts and images (using Markov chains and Context Free Grammars), and interactive stories (through a system for designing hypertextual, interconnected scenes). From the start, Aventura was developed as a bilingual (Spanish and English) alternative to other similar libraries, with the purpose to address idiomatic gaps in computational creativity, and to allow Spanish speaking users to make these types of creative works in their own language. As Takhteyev (2012) has studied, the practice of software development in Latin America occurs in a state of “cultural diglossia”, or existing between two languages at the same time, the default language of coding and software documentation: English, and other local languages: for instance, Spanish or Portuguese. In this sense, addressing the linguistic gap by creating local software helps to reappropriate computational tools for the study of humanities in situated contexts and to reduce knowledge gaps derived from linguistic barriers. This is an important aspect of our project, since the creation of local tools allow us to have agency and control over the expected results, instead of depending on tools created for other social, academic, and infrastructural contexts. Having the power to manipulate the code, and to think in our native language, helped us to develop a system of experimentation, iteration, and streamlining that would have not been possible by the use of black box tools that have their own coding idiosyncrasies.
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region tags=["hermeneutics"] -->
As was described, Aventura.js is a tool for creative coding, but it can be used as well for exploratory research in the humanities and for divulgating the results of such research; having access and understanding of the underlying code helped us to repurpose the original use of the software to a scholarly one. An important underlying proposition of this paper is that strategies from computational creativity can be used as speculative research and communication methods. In this section we focus on the potential of using Aventura’s interactive story system for creating iconographic panels, inspired by the concepts coming from Warburg’s Atlas Mnemosyne described before, and the possibility of extending Warburg’s system of interpretation by means of data visualization and storytelling. We, thus, used Aventura to design a narrative exploration of the iconographic collection of the Carguero images by combining different types of data visualization into the scene structure offered by the JavaScript library.

### Designing an interactive panel
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region tags=["hermeneutics"] -->
First, we created a dataset that contains multiple metadata about our subjective collection of 193 images related to the Carguero iconographic trope. Such dataset can be accessed in its totality in the data section of this paper. For each image, the following data is described (the name of the column in Spanish is indicated in parenthesis): name (“obras”), author (“autor”), date (“fecha”), media (“medio”), artistic technique (“tecnica”), material for producing the image (“material”), material substrate (“soporte”), height in cms (“alto”), width in cms (“ancho”), source (“fuente”), short description (“descripcion”), period (“periodo”), geographical region depicted (“region”), probable country depicted (“país”), path region (“camino”), image ID (“id”), source model (“modelo”), repository holding the image (“repositorio”), procedence (“procedencia”), main visual attribute of the carrier (“atributoCarguero”), main action of the carguero (“accionCarguero”), main visual attribute of the carried person, (“atributoCargado”), number of carriers in the image (“numeroCargueros”), direction of sight of the carrier, (“direccionMiradaCarguero”), direction of sight of the carried (“direccionMiradaCargado”), direction of the body of the carried (“direccionCargado”), gender of the carried (“generoCargado”), relation between foreground and background (“figura/fondo”), painting genre (“genero”), and other (“otros”), that is, images that are not specifically of the Carguero but are used to compare, contrast, or provide context.

<!-- #region tags=["hermeneutics"] -->
Here it is worth reasserting that this collection of images does not intend to be exhaustive, but it is representative. In a Warburgian “good neighbor” spirit, the images collected are part of a lived collecting experience, sometimes intentional but sometimes fortuitous, mostly of one of the authors of this paper; this is specially the case in the post nineteenth century images like memes, parodies, and other types of reappropriations of the Carguero image (mostly, images after 1900). However, we do not see the tools used here as large scale, number crunching machines that extract general formal patterns in machine readable representations of cultural objects (i.e. distant reading qua (Moretti 2013)), but as interfaces that facilitate the process of subjective collection, interpretation, and presentation by the researchers, on one hand, and as tools for exploring arguments visually and interactively by users, allowing them to produce their own interpretations. Following Drucker (2020), we want to make explicit the act of subjective reading, and to use the tool not just for representing, but also for modelling interpretation: “[t]he idea of modelling implies that a graphical expression serves as a primary mode of knowledge production, not a secondary expression of preexisting data. This suggests that a graphical expression might be used to create and/or show the features of a model of interpretative activity” (2). In this sense, our method intends to integrate visual representation, interactivity, and textuality into a historic argument. Such subjectivity, nevertheless, is a rigorous act of applying a data-assisted methodology in the sense of Escobar Varela (2021), that is, using computers to view in different ways, to transform perspectives, and to “to enable alternative readings via a computational defamiliarization strategy” (p. 9).

<!-- #region tags=["hermeneutics"] -->
Next in the process, we used the filtering function of dictionary-like data structures, available in programming languages like Python and Javascript, to create subsets of our main dataset based on conditionals applied over different columns of temporal and categorical data; some of the concrete filters used for the Carguero dataset are described in detail in the next section. We understand conditional filtering as a way to interpret, in the sense of partially focusing on particular elements of interest in a group of objects to get insights that would not be apparent in a space with noisier, competing information. Thus, we use filtering both as a search strategy but also as an argumentative artifact; searching and focusing is useful to make connections evident and to make patterns more salient. This approach resonates with the subbranch of media studies called “software studies” (Manovich 2013; Montfort 2013), which intends to understand and make explicit how computational operations (for instance, loops, randomization, conditionals, functions, etc.) are culturally situated and become epistemological instruments and strategies for knowing and manipulating experience.
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region tags=["hermeneutics"] -->
We then used these filtered data subsets to create multiple graphics based on three types of data visualizations. These graphics are our own attempt at computationally generating Warburgian panels with meaningful intervals (Zwichenraum): circle packed tree maps (keyword “pack”), used to represent nested categorical hierarchies; 2D scatterplots (keyword “scatter”), used to represent relationships between two series of data in a cartesian plane; and simple adjacent dispositions of images (keyword “compare”), used to show particular details in pairs of images that deserve attention. With these three types of visualizations, we intend to show different aspects of our dataset: hierarchies and groupings, changes through time, numeric correlations, visual commonalities or differences. In this way, the particular disposition of each data visualization can be seen as a mechanism for giving emphasis to different Pathosformel, to focus on particular survival of thematic relationships, and to define a particular feature space.

Finally, for creating an interactive story in Aventura.js, one must describe a set of scenes in a JavaScript Object. For each scene, there is a syntax to define interface elements, like the texts, images, buttons, and clickable areas, and hypertext elements —namely, to which other scenes it is possible to jump from the current scenes. An application called Aventura Interactiva, currently in beta version, offers a graphical user interface that facilitates building the scenes system [(To Aventura Interactiva)](https://srsergiorodriguez.github.io/aventura-interactiva/), and it allows exporting the scenes in a JSON file with the correct Aventura.js syntax. With this information, Aventura.js creates an interface that lets the user move between scenes. We propose that this hypertextual system is useful to create a z-dimension in which it is possible to move from one panel to another to further deepen the reading of the dataset and its iconographic relations. This hypertextual z-dimension is in essence non-linear, as the user can make decisions about which other panels or narrative paths to explore. Non-linearity allows the user to get into separate arguments or readings of the same dataset or to move from panoramic view into detailed looks of the objects represented. We defined a set of scenes based on particular readings, available data, and historic arguments about the image of the Carguero. Some of these readings are described in more detail in the following section.

For combining the default scene system of Aventura,js with the requirements of this project, we wrote a set of functions that integrate and preprocess the conditional filtering strategy and the data visualizations before the scenes are rendered. These functions take a conventional Aventura.js set of scenes, enhanced with additional information about the filters and types of visualizations expected for each scene, and, behind the scenes, converts that information into full graphics derived from the limited subset. These ad-hoc functions are currently a prototype that could eventually be fused into the main code of Aventura.js to expand its functionality and to facilitate scholarly projects similar to the one we propose here. At the moment, these additional functions were hosted in a notebook from the coding platform Observable for the JavaScript programming language.

The first model comes from the famous Prussian naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, who, in his diary, and later in his work Vues des Cordillères, recorded his encounter with a Carguero named Villanero. His description of the encounter became famous and a point of reference for a large number of travelers when describing their own experiences. The second one is the model of François Desiré Roulin, a scientific traveler who made part of an expedition composed of French professionals recommended by Georges Cuvier and Alexander von Humboldt to the plenipotentiary minister of Gran Colombia, Francisco Antonio Zea.<br>Note: the panels in this Atlas contain clickable areas.",

The illustrations were made by Louis Thiebaut from many sources, including the so-called Trujillo del Perú Codex (1782–85) and the Malaspina Expedition (1789-1794). Lequanda resided for most of his productive life in Lima, where he contributed to the Mercurio Peruano (1791–94). The material of the Quadro is oil on canvas but it is distinguished by its unusual dimensions (331 cm × 118 cm) and composition: 195 scenes with 381 figures surrounded by explanatory text. In addition, the framed canvas is crowned and gilded with twin cornucopias graced by a sheaf of arrows, symbolising the bounty or ‘treasure’ of the New World under Hispanic Monarchy. The two central geographical images (an east-up map of central Peru, and below it a profile view of the rich mines at Hualgayoc) form an axis that represents the new economic centre of 18th-century Peru, which had shifted from Potosí to the region adjacent to Lima. The central region united three major ecological and productive zones. In the Quadro, this vertical economic geography is represented by the unfolding of a concentric sequence of niches populated by fishes and amphibians, small and large quadrupeds, simians, and humans. The latter is divided in two classes, ‘civilised’ (or coastal and highland) and ‘savage’ (or Amazonian), with each composed of 16 ‘nations’. Birds occupy the perimeter of the Quadro, seemingly lifting the entire canvas on their wings. In a word, the Quadro is a tableau that reveals in a synoptic visual field what today we call ‘biodiversity’ but which in enlightened circles of the times was called ‘the idea of Peru.’ This ‘idea’ held that Peru was a mirror of the universe and the crown jewel of Hispanic Empire'.",

The image can offer aesthetic enjoyment and relevant information to botanists, geologists, mineralogists, and meteorologists. This is because there are plants, landscapes, cloud formations, geological profiles, villages, an inter-Andean valley, an eastern mountain range, multiple signs that show the climate, vegetation, location, and social and productive activities that are carried out with plants and natural resources in general. In addition, it tells a sociological and political story related to Cargueros who work with travelers and who stage a series of socual oppositions and complexities typical of the mountainous Andean world, colonial society, and global society in aprocess of transformation. In the image we see a Carguero who stares at the viewer while walking with his empty chair, probably the one that should have been occupied by Humboldt, who refused to use the service. In this sense, it could be said that the image is a 'picture or scene of nature' which presents a careful organization of the landscape so that various natural and cultural phenomena interact and account for organic functioning.",

And throughout the twentieth century, and even today, these images have been predominantly seen as visual testimonies of the early republic and, as such, have been integrated into narratives of nation building. The images share a series of iconographic coincidences that indicate the practice of adapting models to different contexts by means of details, such as the background, tools, clothing, costumes, and other elements that vary between compositions. These practices show 'multiple authorship' and 'multiple originals' in the postcolonial Hispanic space. An eloquent case is the correspondence and contrast between the plate 'Taking chocolate in Bogotá', from Joseph Brown's collection, and the plate 'Caballero tomando Té', from the 'De Santiago a Mendoza' collection attributed to Alphonse Giast. The characters are in similar positions, but their clothing, hairstyles, skin complexion, watercolor background, and distribution of surrounding elements change from one image to another. One of the most interesting elements of the contrast is the identification of a 'bombilla' for drinking mate on the table in the background of the watercolor attributed to Giast, a practice characteristic of Chile and Argentina that, on the contrary, was not carried out in Nueva Granada.",

In addition, the composition of the space is different, a different perspective with coinciding elements. Roulin's prominence in the visual culture of the early Republican period is extended. For example, Auguste Le Moyne copied the profile of Simón Bolívar drawn by Roulin in 1828; his watercolors were copied and published in the travelogues of Gaspar Mollien (1824), John Potter Hamilton (1827), Guilaume Lallement (1826), Alcide D'Orbigny (1841) and M. A. de Latrre (1848). Modifications of his motifs can also be found in engravings by John Potter Hamilton (1827, 1993), Gaetano Osculati (1954), and Cesar Famin (1837).

Ménage d'une famille de pêcheur' of 1823 seems to be an illustration of the text in which it is mentioned that the 'dogs of hot climate (perros de tierra caliente)' that live with the fishermen on the banks of the Magdalena River, have a deteriorated breed due to lack of food and exceptional conditions that force the animals to return to wild states. In Roulin's Plates, such as 'Bords de la Magdelaine', 'Place de St. Victorin à Bogotá' or 'Entrée du marché de Honda', dogs can be seen living side by side with humans in different climates and regions. This allows us to see how dogs have changed and adapted to different environments and situations, and how they have been affected by the communities in which they live.

    "text": "The sketch of the camp on the Quindío road was reproduced in the biography of Roulin, along with several other sketches, published by Marguerite Combes in 1929. The drawing shows a camp in which a Carguero can be seen at the center of the composition. According to Combes, the man with an open umbrella being loaded is a notary who accompanied Roulin and Boussigault on the mission to inspect and draw up the plan of the mines of La Vega de Supía. Combes mistakenly states that the subject in the lower right is Boussingault. Roulin makes a direct reference to this drawing in a footnote in an article on the Tapir in his collection of scientific papers called 'Histoire naturelle et souvenirs de voyage' of 1865. Roulin made this drawing on behalf of Humboldt. Roulin’s sketch of the Carguero was modified and turned into an engraving in Alcide d'Orbigny's travelogue, 'Voyage Pittoresque dans les deux Amériques', a popular book that contributed significantly to the dissemination of knowledge of Colombia in Europe. D'Orbigny, a mollusk specialist, belonged to the same scientific circle as Cuvier and Roulin. Like the latter, he was credited as a 'disciple' in the 1836 edition of Le Règne Animal. In fact, his figure plays a fundamental role in research on the determination of the racial characteristics of Americans for Cuvier's classification of that book. In 1825, he was commissioned by the Museum of Natural History in Paris to investigate 'in depth the language and physiological characteristics' of South American people. As an analytical tool, Roulin and d'Ornigny helped transpose, from the comparative anatomy of animals, the category of 'type' to find a way to organize the multiplicity of human populations existing in America. In this sense, Roulin's and d'Orbigny's Carguero drawings can be interpreted as an investigation into a 'social type' that existed because of specific climatic, geographical, and racial features. These are rationalized by the observations of the external characters and their relations with internal organic functioning. Roulin refers to the Carguero as a 'human mount', hinting at a comparison of different modes of transportation and uses of human and animal muscle-driven motion power.",

After returning to his homeland, he published his travelogue with the famous publishing house John Murray. This publishing house was noted, among other things, for tapping into the demand for such products, and published more than 200 travel books during the first half of the 19th century. Hamilton used, with adaptations, several of Roulin's models in his book. In particular, the image of the Carguero changes the direction of the characters and places them on a laborious ascent. They climb around a tree on the curve of a steep mountain road (see graphical comparison). The image is similar to other images of the period, like those in the travelogues of British merchant traveller Charles Stuart Cochrane and Swedish diplomatic traveller August Gosselman. These images are characterized by the use of a picturesque aesthetic as a strategy to frame the landscape and recompose it with industrious human figures, settlements, crops, and productive animals, in contrast to the untamed wilderness that still needs to be controlled by man. In these stories, the images coexist with visual metaphors that frame the observations of nature as 'pictures', 'paintings', 'drawings', 'sketches', 'maps', 'scenery', 'beautiful shows', 'dioramas', 'panoramas', 'magic lanterns' or 'Peep Shows'. The use of the Carguero image is indicative of the resignification of picturesque aesthetics in the voyages to America, characterized by the use of ethnographic and social themes of concern to travellers of the period, who were, in Mary Louis Pratt's words, the avant-garde of capitalism.",

The Collection: L'Univers Pittoresque, in which Famin participated, and d'Orbigny's Voyage pittoresque, are examples of how, in France, the 'picturesque' was understood as a publishing guideline; a way of making books and periodicals, richly illustrated and with complex logistical processes.  The books and images of the travellers are used as privileged sources of information for these encyclopedic projects with pretensions of synthesis. An image of the Carguero is representative of this procedure. It does not pretend to be a faithful representation of nature, but rather constructs a generic exoticizing space that synthesizes Famin's entire journey through Guyana and Colombia. Different human types and their costumes are arranged in juxtaposition to establish comparisons and contrasts between them.

These magazines were local versions of The Penny Magazine, first published in the United Kingdom in 1832 by the Society for the dissemination of useful knowledge. The model of this weekly magazine soon spread to various parts of Europe, disseminating not only the format of a publication, but technological applications of woodcutting and prototyping, a process of rationalization of print production, a business model and an ideal of the correlation between the expansion of the readership market and the possibility of bringing access to 'useful' knowledge to the working classes. Magasin Pittoresque, for example, was first published by Édouard Charton in 1833 and is associated with a faction of saintsimonism called 'republican saintsimonism'. Charton expressly referred to his publishing projects as means by which he intended to 'combat the ignorance of the popular classes' (Le Magasin Pittoresque, 1833, p. 98). Dissemination was made possible by the recent invention of metal plate engraving processes useful to obtain copies in 'hundreds of thousands' (Le Magasin Pittoresque, 1833, p. 98). In this context, images reached a wider public and offered a quicker and more fun way of learning from which children would benefit: 'instead of letting them sleep or yawn over a book, take them often to museums, or even to boulevards, georamas and panoramas' (Le Magasin Pittoresque, 1833, p. 99). Likewise, in the Semanario Pintoresco Español, images are mentioned for their function of 'representing absent things as if they were before us and which we could only see at the cost of arduous journeys and great expense’ (Semanario Pintoresco Español, 1844, p. 48).",

One additional, important aspect of this method for creating interactive panels is its potential expandability: besides the automated method of filtering for creating subsets and the definition of standard visualizations, the Aventura.js scene system works in a way that facilitates the creation of additional personalized panels (following the initial intuitive dispositions that gave origin to this project) and the addition of hyperlinks that connect to additional information. In our case, we added an automatized set of scenes that contain information about each element in the dataset and links to the original repositories in which they are hosted. This strategy expands the readings of the archive in the sense that it can work both inside the panel, offering a particular disposition and interpretation, and outside the panel, in a world of dispersed collections that have their own good neighbors and potentially new associations.

## A guided tour of the Carguero Atlas: the path of Humboldt and Roulin


In this section we offer further description of both the design and our understanding of one of the narrative paths of the Carguero Atlas. Specifically, we focus on two iconographical derivative models: Humboldt's and Roulin's, and the insights obtained from the process of panel building. We also invite the reader of this article to explore and navigate the Atlas in order to find non-linear narratives that cannot be accounted for in the conventional organization of this article’s text.


We can divide our Carguero collection into two large groups of images: 19th century images, which have been collected comprehensively, and reinterpretations created post 19th century (namely, remixes, artworks, memes, and other intertextual works); for this second group, the images collected are representative of possible use cases, but are by no means exhaustive of the multiplicity of works circulating in popular culture. For one of the narrative paths we created for the Carguero Atlas we propose in this article, we defined a set of scenes in which we used a filter to obtain only images until the 19th century (in the filter system described as \[“date”, "<", 1900\]). In particular, we were interested in visualizing the tagged categories “figure/background” (in Spanish, “figura/fondo”), “source model” (“modelo”), “date” (“fecha”) and “period” (“periodo”). The "Figure/background" category indicates the proportion between figure and background in the image: the images that predominantly represent landscapes without human figures are labeled as "background" (“fondo”), the images that predominantly represent landscapes that contain humans are labeled as "balance" (“equilibrio”), and the images in which there is a predominance of human figures are labeled as "figure" (“figura”). On the other hand, the “source model” category groups images according to the model they are based on: we identified a set of iconographic models that were extensively used and reappropriated in subsequent images. The most important models to consider are the ones labeled “humboldt” and “roulin” in our dataset. The first one comes from the famous Prussian naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, who, in his diary, and later in his work Vues des Cordillères <cite data-cite="7299034/49SACHS5">(Humboldt, 1810)</cite>, recorded his encounter with a Carguero named Villanero. Thanks to Humboldt’s prestige as a traveler, and the profuse circulation of his travel stories —mostly apocryphal editions of unscrupulous publishers who took advantage of his fame— his description of the encounter became famous and a point of reference for a large number of travelers when describing their own experiences. Second, there is the “source model” of François Desiré Roulin, a scientific traveler who made part of an expedition composed of French professionals recommended by Georges Cuvier and Alexander von Humboldt to the plenipotentiary minister of Gran Colombia —the name at the time of the state roughly equivalent to the current Republic of Colombia—, Francisco Antonio Zea.


For one of the scenes (Scene name: scatterPeriodoFigura), and using the custom functions we created for adapting Aventura.js system to our purposes, we defined a scatter plot panel (keyword “scatter”) in representing the attribute "period" on the X axis and the attribute "figure/background" on the Y axis. We can observe in the resulting panel that there are more images labeled as "background" or as "balance" in the period between 1770 and 1810 than in the other periods. Specimens from the late colonial period (1770-1810) accounted for, or participated in, a transformation in visual epistemology characterized by presenting different human types, understood as castes or nations, as characters in their immediate geographical contexts, including the animal and botanical varieties peculiar to them <cite data-cite="7299034/8JZZYA7Z">(Bleichmar, 2012)</cite>. Variations of the trope of placing human specimens in their geographical and natural contexts can be seen, for instance, in Vicente Albán's mestizaje paintings, and in Cuadro del Peru commissioned by Ignacio Lecuanda <cite data-cite="undefined">(Bleichmar, 2012)</cite>. This transformation is, paradigmatically, also present in Humboldt's views of nature. Plate V of Vues des Cordillères <cite data-cite="7299034/49SACHS5">(Humboldt, 1810)</cite> is Humboldt’s representation of the Carguero, and participates within this visual episteme; furthermore, the plate’s production and meaning are affected by the American continent social networks in which Humboldt's journey, journal entries, and sketches were produced <cite data-cite="7299034/KWRLHZYH">(Cañizares-Esguerra & Thurner, 2022)</cite> and by the European social networks that supported the conversion of sketches and notes into images and texts, and put them into a global comparative horizon <cite data-cite="7299034/4TSNQZT6">(Bourguet, 2017)</cite>. In the image representation, there is a balance between the natural elements and activities of the Carguero: both are elements that structure the composition and provide relevant information to understand the use of plants, means of transport, and other particularities of Andean verticality. This explains why we can see in the panel that during this period the attribute "balance" is predominant.


On the other hand, from the period 1819-1850 onwards we can notice a predominance of "figure" over "background" and "balance.” It is worth highlighting that the most used model during the period “1819 – 1850” was Roulin’s. This can be seen in a panel that shows a scatter plot contrasting “period” on the Y axis with “source model” on the X axis (Scene name: "scatterRoulin"). It can also be seen in another panel that depicts a circle pack tree map (Scene name: "packRoulin") filtered to include only the period "1819-1850,” and displaying the hierarchical organization of the attributes "source model" and "background and figure”. It is striking that this is the most used model, since all travelers quote Humboldt as a reference for the description of the Carguero, but they do not use his image as a model. As the initial compare graph (Scene name: 'start') of two adjacent images included in our atlas shows, there are clear differences in style in both models. It is especially important to note that Humboldt's image integrates the Carguero as a part of the landscape, whereas Roulin’s highlights its saliency and physical characteristics. On another circle pack tree map (Scene name: "packHumboldtPeriodo") with the “source model” attribute filtered by "humboldt,” and displaying the hierarchical organization of the attributes "period" and "figure/background", it can be observed that, in the "1819-1850" period, the images which used Humboldt’s image as a model turned the “landscape” into “figures,” and others took the “figures” out and turned the images into “background.”


For another panel (Scene name: "roulinModel"), we defined a circle pack tree map with a filter for obtaining only Roulin’s derivations. In this panel we can see the great diversity of contexts in which this model transformed its meaning, adapted by communities of interpretation that demanded new epistemic and aesthetic criteria of validity. In this way, Roulin (1824) and later Alcide d'Orbigny (1841) use the category of "type" produced within the circle of the Académie des sciences in Paris, to create their image of the Carguero. This model was reinterpreted in different contexts. Colonel John Potter Hamilton (1827) linked it to British "picturesque" explorations for political and commercial purposes, while Cesar Famin's entry on Colombia in L'Universe Pittoresque associated it with the genre of costumes. Additionally, the image was featured in various European popular illustrated press magazines, including the Magasin Pittoresque (1848), the Semanario Pintoresco Español (1849), and Das Pfennig-Magazin (1851). Despite all these sources citing Humboldt's encounter with the Carguero, they favored Roulin's drawing as a suitable model for the growing interest in exploring American human types.


These data assisted readings of our collection by using interactive panels take us to the following question: why the travelers who were in “Colombia/Nueva Granada” in the period “1819-1851” did not use Humboldt’s Carguero model? What aesthetic, technical, and epistemic conditions made it possible for Roulin's model to circulate and to be re-signified in the different interpretation communities in which it was adapted? By reviewing the primary sources and secondary literature, we conclude that two factors must be considered to answer these questions. The first reason is technological, related to the techniques of inscription and practices of image circulation. The second is epistemological and rhetorical, related to the audiences that the inscriptions intended to affect. Bruno Latour understands these two aspects as part of the same process: the interest in inscriptions is understandable insofar as it is related to the trajectories, routes, and expansive plans that their technology and structure make possible. Correlatively, displacement allows for innovations in inscriptions, writing, archiving, and processing, which only make sense to the extent that they persuade and gain adherence in the midst of controversies <cite data-cite="7299034/CT29YC4T">(Latour, 2012)</cite>.


The drawings and images made by Roulin participated in a network of image circulation related to 19th century visual culture, such as the rationalization of production, division of labor, and mass production for a market of travelers who were interested in these products. In the contemporary period, collections of images of travelers who were in South America at the beginning of the 19th century have become known thanks to donations from private collectors. This is the case of the Alphonse Giast collection in Argentina and Chile (<cite data-cite="7299034/P9BQM6PD">Carril, 1964</cite>;<cite data-cite="7299034/NINP9SWY">Pereira Salas, 1962</cite>), Joseph Brown collection, Le Moyne collection, and Roulin collection in Colombia (<cite data-cite="7299034/TJVGPCC8">Alvarez Rincón, 2003</cite>;<cite data-cite="7299034/Y6X6CWGR">Deas et al., 1989</cite>;<cite data-cite="7299034/YJIU4CYH">Le Moyne et al., 2003</cite>). Throughout the twentieth century, and even today, these images have been predominantly seen as visual testimonies of the early republic and, as such, have been integrated into narratives of nation building. Recently, researchers have compared the collections, including the corpus of images attributed to Roulin, and have found a series of iconographic coincidences that indicate the existence of practices of adapting models to different contexts by means of details, such as the background, tools, clothing, costumes, and other elements that vary between compositions <cite data-cite="7299034/RTPHGI8V">(De la Maza et al., 2016)</cite>. These practices have been analyzed by researchers by using concepts such as "multiple authorship" and "multiple originals", allowing them to be placed on the horizon of other image-making practices that took place throughout South America in the postcolonial Hispanic space.


Thus, Roulin's prominence in the visual culture of the early Republican period has been highlighted by other scholarship <cite data-cite="7299034/MZ9FSNZV">(Antei, 1995)</cite>. For example, Auguste Le Moyne copied the profile of Simón Bolívar drawn by Roulin in 1828 <cite data-cite="7299034/ZF79WP3U">(Vanegas, 2012)</cite>. Likewise, his watercolors were copied and published in the travelogues of Gaspar Mollien (1824), John Potter Hamilton (1827), Guilaume Lallement (1826), Alcide D'Orbigny (1841) and M. A. de Latrre (1848). Modifications of his motifs can also be found in engravings by John Potter Hamilton (1827, 1993), Gaetano Osculati (1954), and Cesar Famin (1837). Thus, it has been speculated that Roulin may have had a catalogue of plates at the service of travelers with scenes of customs, types, views, and monuments (<cite data-cite="undefined">Antei, 1995</cite>; <cite data-cite="7299034/RTPHGI8V">De la Maza et al., 2016</cite>).


In relation to the aesthetic and scientific conditions of acceptability, Roulin's conceptual and visual universe is directly related to his scientific training as a physiologist practicing comparative anatomy in the scientific circle of the Académie des sciences in Paris. Roulin traveled to Colombia as a member of a scientific expedition that the plenipotentiary minister Francisco Antonio Zea had arranged for personalities such as Georges Cuvier and Alexander von Humboldt (<cite data-cite="7299034/HBG4E7CR">Del Castillo, 2018</cite>;<cite data-cite="7299034/84ASJI2S">Rodriguez-Prada, 2013</cite>). Likewise, he published some of the results of his research in the Annales des sciences naturelles (<cite data-cite="7299034/QU7TF99V">Audouin et al., 1829a</cite>,<cite data-cite="7299034/8BS2RPC8">Audouin et al., 1829b</cite>) and was involved in the posthumous edition of Le Règne Animal created by Cuvier's disciples in 1836 (<cite data-cite="7299034/VAD5AUXZ">Cuvier et al., 1836</cite>). Roulin's watercolors and drawings, some of them made with the help of a camera lucida (Roulin in <cite data-cite="7299034/QU7TF99V">Audouin et al., 1829a, p. 29</cite>), show his interest in highlighting aspects related to the animal and human classification that had been postulated in this scientific circle, which, from a visual point of view, sought to establish relationships between external characters, with the systematic functioning of internal organs (<cite data-cite="7299034/SU34NHK8">Foucault, 1997, p. 247</cite>; Senior, 2018). In the specific classification of the human race as a bipedal mammal, Cuvier considered that its development was determined by external aspects, such as climate or geography, and internal aspects, such as the intellectual characteristics of the races <cite data-cite="7299034/VAD5AUXZ">(Cuvier et al., 1836, pp. 97-98)</cite>. These were organized in a hierarchy that descended from the Caucasian race to the Ethiopian, which was represented as the least developed. The position of Americans in this classification was uncertain, since it was not possible to resolve the multiplicity of characteristics observed in the same category <cite data-cite="7299034/VAD5AUXZ">(Cuvier et al., 1836, pp. 103-104)</cite>. In fact, Roulin drew from Cuvier’s disciples edition of Le Règne Animal some of the plates of American types that illustrate their difficult classification, and is cited as one of the travellers who provided information on the subject <cite data-cite="7299034/VAD5AUXZ">(Cuvier et al., 1836b, pl XIV)</cite>.


Consequently, it is understandable that Roulin’s sketch of the Carguero was modified and turned into an engraving in Alcide d'Orbigny's travelogue, Voyage Pittoresque dans les deux Amériques <cite data-cite="7299034/IC53A5GV">(d'Orbigny, 1841)</cite>, a popular book that contributed significantly to the dissemination of knowledge of Colombia in Europe. D'Orbigny, a mollusk specialist, belonged to the same scientific circle as Cuvier and Roulin. Like the latter, he was credited as a "disciple" in the 1836 edition of Le Règne Animal. In fact, his figure plays a fundamental role in research on the determination of the racial characteristics of Americans for Cuvier's classification of Le Règne Animal. In 1825, he was commissioned by the Museum of Natural History in Paris to investigate "in depth the language and physiological characteristics" of South American peoples <cite data-cite="7299034/XQRMQ6JZ">(d'Orbigny, 1839, p. IX)</cite>. As an analytical tool, Roulin and d'Ornigny helped transpose, from the comparative anatomy of animals, the category of "type" to find a way to organise the multiplicity of human populations existing in America. In this sense, Roulin's and d'Orbigny's Carguero drawings can be interpreted as an investigation into a "social type" that existed because of specific climatic, geographical, and racial features. These are rationalized by the observations of the external characters of people and their relations with internal organic functioning. Roulin refers to the Carguero as a "human mount"<cite data-cite="7299034/JVP6N5AR">(Roulin, 1865, p. 263)</cite>, pointing at a comparison of different modes of transportation and uses of human and animal muscle-driven motion power.


Another derivation of Roulin's model of the Carguero is found in the travelogue of the British Diplomat Colonel John Potter Hamilton <cite data-cite="7299034/ZJA9TWSP">(Hamilton, 1827)</cite>, the first official envoy on behalf of the British government to Colombia. After returning to his homeland, he published his travelogue with the famous publishing house John Murray. This publishing house was noted, among other things, for tapping into the demand for such products, and published more than 200 travel books during the first half of the 19th century <cite data-cite="7299034/YJEB294J">(Keighren & Withers, 2011, p. 1334)</cite>. Hamilton used, with adaptations, several of Roulin's models in his book. However, the new disposition of the image of the Carguero changes the direction of the characters and places them on a laborious ascent. They climb around a tree on the curve of a steep mountain road (see graphical comparison on scene called "roulinHamilton"). The image is similar to other images of the period, such as those in the travelogues of British merchant traveller Charles Stuart Cochrane <cite data-cite="7299034/E4J6TU6R">(Cochrane, 1825)</cite> and Swedish diplomatic traveller August Gosselman (<cite data-cite="7299034/HQUVJJ2V">Gosselman, 1828</cite>;<cite data-cite="7299034/7F7VVS9Z">Gosselman, 1981</cite>). These images are characterized by the use of a picturesque aesthetic that functions as a device to frame the landscape and organize it with industrious human figures, settlements, crops, and productive animals, in contrast to the untamed wilderness that still needs to be controlled by man. In these stories, the images coexist with visual metaphors that frame the observations of nature as "pictures", "paintings", "drawings", "sketches", "maps", "scenery", "beautiful shows", "dioramas", "panoramas", "magic lanterns" or "Peep Shows". The use of the Carguero image is then indicative of the resignification of picturesque aesthetics in the voyages to America, characterized by the use of ethnographic and social themes of concern to travellers of the period <cite data-cite="7299034/WFVWC9QP">(Diener, 2007)</cite>, who were described by Mary Louis Pratt as the avant-garde of capitalism <cite data-cite="7299034/QCYRHZVF">(Pratt, 1992)</cite>.


Likewise, through Hamilton, Roulin's model found its way into the volume on Colombia of the monumental 67-volume encyclopedic Universal Picturesque Collection, in which the cabinet traveller César Famin arranged, on a generic natural background, a set of figures intended to imagine the costumes of Colombia and Guyana. The "Universal picturesque collection" (Collection: L'Univers Pittoresque) in which Famin participated, and d'Orbigny's "picturesque journey" (Voyage pittoresque), are examples of how in France "the picturesque" was understood as a publishing guideline; a way of making books and periodicals, richly illustrated and with complex logistical processes <cite data-cite="7299034/SPLKI368">(Jeanjean-Becker, 2018)</cite>. The books and images of the travelers present are used as privileged sources for these encyclopedic projects with pretensions of synthesis to take place. The image of the Carguero is representative of this procedure. It does not pretend to be a faithful representation of nature, but rather constructs a generic wild space that synthesizes his entire journey through Guyana and Colombia, on which different human types and their costumes are arranged to juxtapose them and establish comparisons and contrasts. In this way, the pretension of travel books to bring distant geography closer so that it can be experienced without leaving home is realized with cabinet travels and, at the same time, replicated.


Finally, by focusing on his figure instead of the background, the Carguero drawing let A. de Lattre to contrast the practice of the Quindío road with the estiveros of Putumayo. This made it possible for the image to be used in mass-production projects in Europe and for it to be circulated, held on an engraving plate, by various illustrated press companies in countries such as France (Magasin Pittoresque, 1848), Spain (Semanario Pintoresco Español, 1849) and Germany (Das Pfennig-Magazin, 1851). These magazines were local versions of The Penny Magazine, first published in the United Kingdom in 1832 by the Society for the dissemination of useful knowledge. The model of this weekly magazine soon spread to various parts of Europe, disseminating not only the format of a publication, but technological applications of woodcutting and prototyping, a process of rationalization of print production, a business model and an ideal of the correlation between the expansion of the readership market and the possibility of bringing access to "useful" knowledge to the working classes. Magasin Pittoresque, for example, was first published by Édouard Charton in 1833 and is associated with a faction of saintsimonism called "republican saintsimonism" <cite data-cite="7299034/PQI8HPJH">(Aurenche, 2021)</cite>. Charton explicitly referred to his publishing projects as means by which he intended to "combat the ignorance of the popular classes" (Le Magasin Pittoresque, 1833, p. 98). Dissemination was made possible by the recent invention of metal plate engraving processes that made it possible to obtain copies in "hundreds of thousands" (Le Magasin Pittoresque, 1833, p. 98). In this context, images make it possible to reach a wider public, to leave a lasting impression, and a quicker and more fun way of learning from which children benefit: "instead of letting them sleep or yawn over a book, take them often to museums, or even to boulevards, georamas and panoramas" (Le Magasin Pittoresque, 1833, p. 99). Likewise, in the Semanario Pintoresco Español, images are mentioned for their function of "representing absent things as if they were before us and which we could only see at the cost of arduous journeys and great expense’ (Semanario Pintoresco Español, 1844, p. 48).


## Discussion


### The Carguero models


This study has shown how storytelling and visualization tools can be of great help in organizing research data and producing interactive interfaces for developing historical narratives and arguments. By classifying visual material in terms of specific formal details, themes, or iconographic characters, researchers can follow historical and geographical trajectories in a heterogeneity of sources, periods, and places. Moreover, this heterogeneity can be advantageous for observing the relationships between different epistemic registers, publishing companies, image-making practices, uses, and functions. The use of similar models in this heterogeneity makes it possible to identify common patterns that would otherwise go unnoticed. Although this approach may present some risks, such as anachrony or dispersion of the research object, it can provide a different perspective of images and their role in the history of visual and print culture. This is because it focuses not on authors or genres, but on the trajectory of the iconographic characters that circulate between different contexts of interpretation. In this study, we delineated a possible trajectory by considering the possible relationships suggested by some of the categories in our dataset.


For instance, one question we explored in our dataset was why the travelers in 19th century Colombia, who always used Alexander von Humboldt as a reference to narrate their experience of the encounter with the Carguero, did not use Humboldt’s image of the Carguero as a model for their illustrated traveling diaries, but instead used that of Francois Desiré Roulin. The answer to this question can be approached by considering the double status that images have in the context of controversies in science and technology, according to Bruno Latour <cite data-cite="7299034/CT29YC4T">(Latour, 2012)</cite>. On the one hand, there is the problem of the possibilities afforded by technology and the processes of rationalizing the mass production of images for a market that demands such products. This relates to the technologies of serial reproduction of handmade images, the use of copies and models for technical reproducibility, and their printing in bookprints and periodicals. In this study, it was shown that Roulin’s model was at the center of an intense circulation of images of intercontinental scope, whose trajectories and drifts took us to mid-nineteenth-century Europe, through travel book printing companies in Britain and encyclopedias and picturesque periodicals with practices of rationalization of production in France. On the other hand, there are rhetorical procedures that use the inscriptions as tools to win allies and convince in the midst of scientific, political, or technical controversies. In this sense, it was observed that images circulated not only for their technological possibilities but also for epistemological and argumentative needs in contexts in which historical actors faced different types of controversies, such as the racial classification of populations, the economic and political utility of certain territories, and the need to extend the universe of readers in the midst of popular projects for the circulation of knowledge. In all of these contexts, images played an important epistemological role. By means of a dialectic between direct observation of the object and the distance that obliges its elaboration through the mediation of inscription technology, travelers, in person and in the cabinet, allowed others, through images, to travel and access knowledge of the world from a distance.


We intended to track an iconographic motif through time and space in a manner similar to Warburg what intended to do with Renaissance interpretation of the pathetic motifs of expression (Pathosformel) of antiquity. While the themes of classical beauty and pathetic gestures of the ancient world seem foreign to our corpus, we must remember that Warburg himself was a European traveler in America. In 1895, he visited the “Indios Pueblo” in New Mexico, USA. Warburg was confronted with problems similar to those of our travelers, although his disciplinary and technological tools were different. This trip was recorded using photographs  (Mann & Guidi, 1998) and presented in a famous lecture at the end of his internment in a psychiatric clinic in Kreuzlingen in 1923 <cite data-cite="7299034/8AVE49LH">(Warburg, 1995)</cite>. In this experience, under the context of the emergence of social sciences, Warburg sought to establish contact between art history and anthropology. He wanted to question how symbols mediate reality and enable the construction of distance for reflection (Denkraum). Warburg considered this a tragic process that is never fully achieved. So it was with his journey, for in trying to find common ground between antiquity and "primitive man" he could not avoid projecting his Eurocentric prejudices and ignoring the complexity of the processes he witnessed <cite data-cite="7299034/H2LJLXTS">(Freedberg, 2005)</cite>. The travelers who encountered the Carguero also tried to use images as a mediation with unknown nature and characters to rationalize and better understand them. As in Warburg's case, these attempts to establish distance were tragic, insofar as the distance they created often did not allow them to recognize those who were judged as savages, and unfit to be part of Civilization.


### The interactive panels


For Antón-Barco, “Mnemosyne created a new kind of knowledge (visual) that intends to gather, through images, the dispersion –but also the secret coherence– of our entire world. It combines the aesthetic paradigm of the visual-form with an epistemic paradigm of knowledge." <cite data-cite="7299034/JS2I4PY3">(Antón-Barco 2014:53)</cite>. We intended to show how such historical strategy for studying visual sources and visual culture can be expanded by means of digital tools. This involved creating a subjective collection, from the consultation of physical and digital archives and the recompilation of fortuitous connections derived from the principle of good neighborliness. Then, we adopted the computational process of filtering as an interpretative strategy and created a version of Warburg’s montage and homogenization strategies by using adapted conventions from the field of data visualization, and finally we constructed a narrative account based on a non-linear structure that connected the panels through different interactive, hypertextual paths. These strategies helped us to both create a rich presentation and interpretation of the historical sources and to discover new relationships and readings of the data.


One particular challenge for this project was to find adequate graphical representations for the kind of relations we were interested in showing in our dataset. As was mentioned, most of our dataset consists of categorical data, iteratively constructed and manually tagged, which need special types of visualizations: not exclusively cartesian and based on numeric isomorphism between data and shape proportions, but also able to show hierarchies, relationships, and groupings. As <cite data-cite="7299034/779MQTKK">(Rodríguez Gómez, 2021)</cite> points out, it is necessary to find special kinds of data visualizations for humanities data that make justice to the complexity of cultural relationships. Our effort to build a narrative z-dimension intended to work towards that purpose, but further research can be built upon this foundation to create new, more interactive ways to enhance exploration and divulgation of mostly categorical datasets.


Another challenge is the defense of subjectivity in the context of scholar research in the humanities that use computational tools. The use of computation sometimes hides the multiple decisions made in a research project under the guise of supposed mechanical objectivity of computers. We, following authors like Drucker <cite data-cite="7299034/ZAMMD7FP">(2020)</cite>, wanted to make explicit such subjectivity and to defend its value. Collecting is a process that helps to enrich historical readings of documents, in our case, visual pieces. Further research should also work towards a reconciliation between mechanical feature-based problems and the introduction of subjective, but rigorous, reading. At the end, the goal on projects of this nature should be to find fruitful between user independent mechanistic approaches and interpretative approaches <cite data-cite="7299034/ZAMMD7FP">(Drucker 2020)</cite>.


In this line, one possible enhancement of our method would be to include graphs, adjacency matrices, and other networks representations. One potential advantage of our scene-based method is that the Atlas can be, virtually, expanded indefinitely. New scenes can be added due to its modular nature and can be integrated into the current interpretation and discoveries. Another particular addition would be to track the navigation of users in order to reflect on practices of navigating and adapting an archive. The principle of good neighborliness can be further expanded to connect to different repositories and archives or to allow user feedback and collaborative collections.
